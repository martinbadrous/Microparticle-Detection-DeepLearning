# Microplastics Detection with YOLOv5

Detect microplastics in microscopic images using a high-speed YOLOv5 pipeline.

---

## ðŸš€ Motivation
Microplastics pollution is a global problem. Detecting microplastics efficiently is critical for environmental monitoring. This project implements an end-to-end pipeline to detect microplastics from microscopic images using deep learning.

---

## ðŸ§ª Dataset
- Microscope images captured via microfluidic chips  
- Number of images: X training, Y validation, Z test  
- Images labeled with bounding boxes for each microplastic particle
